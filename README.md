# Tomi's Tools

A collection of assorted utilites that may or may not be useful at any given moment. Available [live on the web](https://tools.tomichen.com/).

I've always wanted a simple utility site where I can throw up some simple custom tools when I need them. The utilites here are either simple enough to collect together, or something custom I haven't found anywhere else. Who knows, maybe they might be useful to you!

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
